## Reproducible Pitch Presentation

**Pitch Repository** http://crazyfarang.github.io/BMIPitch/index.html

After made the Shiny app, make your pitch. 
- You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app.

Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line).

You can also do it manually, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/ though remember the slidify publish command takes care of this for you if you'd like.
